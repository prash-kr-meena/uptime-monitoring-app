openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem


for the https support we need, we need to create a SSL certificate, that we can use withing the app to
facilitate the SSL HandShake and so forth

--> to create then SSL certificate we can install the OpenSSL tool  with the command below :
    openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
